# Decision Tree Implementation Assignment Code
My manual implementation of a Decision Tree for an assignment in the [Machine Learning: Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification) course on Coursera.

The goal of the assignment was to **implement a decision tree by hand** in order to understand how they work, however the provided starter code was not vectorized and somewhat messy so I decided to perform [my own implementation from scratch](https://github.com/JP-DataScienceProjects/DecisionTreeImplementation/blob/master/Code/DecisionTreeImplementation.ipynb).

This code sample demonstrates my understanding of **decision trees**, **machine learning principles** for classification problems as well as general **Python** and **object-oriented programming**.
